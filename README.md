# ðŸŽ¬ The Billion-Dollar Mirage  
**A Data Storytelling Project by Julian Hinds (2025)**  
*Exploring how global events, streaming, and franchise economics reshaped the modern film industry.*

---

## ðŸ§­ Overview
Between 2000 and 2025 cinema reached record highs, collapsed during COVID-19, and re-emerged into a radically different world.  
This project blends **data analysis**, **visual storytelling**, and **business insight** to explain how billion-dollar blockbusters made Hollywood both stronger â€” and more fragile.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives
- Quantify the rise and decline of global box office revenue.  
- Examine how streaming and pandemic behaviour changed audience habits.  
- Compare ticket price inflation vs real attendance.  
- Explore how independent films thrived under constraint.  
- Show how the gaming industry and attention economy reshaped entertainment.

## ðŸ§© Key Insights
1. **The COVID Cliff** â€“ Global box office fell â‰ˆ 80 % in 2020 and has not fully recovered.  
2. **Franchise Fragility** â€“ MCU-era profits masked structural risk; post-2019 returns halved.  
3. **The Disney+ Effect** â€“ Streaming turned studios into their own competitors.  
4. **Price â‰  Attendance** â€“ Ticket prices more than doubled since 1996 while ticket sales fell â‰ˆ 40 %.  
5. **Creativity in Constraint** â€“ Micro-budget indies hit record ROI during lockdowns.  
6. **The Attention War** â€“ AAA games (GTA VI, LoL) now out-perform films in 24-hour view counts and cultural pull.
